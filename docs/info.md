Present a clear, 45° top-down view of a vertical (9:16) isometric miniature 3D cartoon scene, highlighting iconic landmarks centered in the composition to showcase precise and delicate modeling.

The scene features soft, refined textures with realistic PBR materials and gentle, lifelike lighting and shadow effects. Weather elements are creatively integrated into the urban architecture, establishing a dynamic interaction between the city's landscape and atmospheric conditions, creating an immersive weather ambiance.

Use a clean, unified composition with minimalistic aesthetics and a soft, solid-colored background that highlights the main content. The overall visual style is fresh and soothing.
